# Fatality-Analysis-Reporting-System-Classification

This work uses FARS dataset that contains data on a census of fatal traffic crashes within the 50 States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico in order to classify fatality of accidents bases on various parameters. Data cleaning, data normalisation and PCA are applied to the dataset before applying various machine learning models in order to predict the fatality. These models were hypertuned and then the correctness of the models is calculated and compared.
